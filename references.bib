Socio-economic change, cereal production and climatic deterioration in Early Medieval Ireland - Kerr, Thomas R.; Swindles, Graeme T.; Plunkett, Gill) The paper attempts to correlate a patchy historical record of weather from Ireland (spanning 650–900 CE) with a palaeoclimate proxy of water table level from a raised bog. The author claims that the two records are in agreement. He then tries to explain changes in social and economic systems in light of apparent changes in climate. According to the author, the climate in the region became cooler/wetter which was bad for grazing animals throughout the year and so the economy shifted towards a more agricultural system dependent on wheat and barley, which were not substantially affected by the climate change. No evidence of the relative sensitivity of the two economic systems to this kind of climate change is presented and the synchronology is naive.},

It is not at all clear what constitutes a demographically relevant change in PSD.},

They don't do either of these very well, but at least they aren't uncritically using SPDs as demographic proxies.   The lit review for SPDs is pretty good in here, at least it's comprehensive and has lots of references, even if it's uncritical. The authors also made the only attempt I've seen so far to actually correlate climate data and cultural data using statistics instead of just visual matching. They fail to account for all of the effects of their data smoothing and there's a lot of questions raised by their approach, but it does constitute an attempt.},
